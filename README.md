# CNN_CIFAR100_Homework
This repository is dedicated to the homework assignment for the Convolutional Neural Networks, part of our Machine Learning program. The modified pipeline should then be applied to the CIFAR-100 dataset, a well-known dataset provided by TensorFlow, consisting of 60,000 32x32 color images in 100 classes.
